# CS4006Project


26-03-2020
Okay so the idea I have for this project is to use the Board class to generate the 8x8 grid, each square will be it's own instance of Square 
class.

The Graph class will be where the A* algorthim will be coded.

The Point and Path classes are two things I'm not sure of. I think there may be a better approach to it. 
The Point class would just mark the turning parts of the Path, 
while the Path class would just be the collection of Points and contain methods that would describe the length of the Path.
